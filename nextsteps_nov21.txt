1. create 4 animations
    - launch (non-looped) animation that plays on pressing launch ubtton
    - in flight (loopsed) which shows rocket flying in center of screen with clouds behind it (with YOU WIN over screen, and restart arrow)
    - win, same as in flight, but clouds are stars, and blue sky is space
    - lose, in flight but the motion of the clouds is reversed (with YOU LOSE over screen, and restart arrow)
2. make sure that the canvas is displaying teh right animation based on where we toggle the animations.
    - look at the places where this.isAnimating is set, these are where the animations will change
3. tweaking hte values. thinking out the economy system.
